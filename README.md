# Auto installer

it's a program on bash because I need somehting that automatically install 
all software that I currently use in each day.

"+" character, symbolize that add that program to the "List to install" and 
"-" character, symbolize that remove that program from the "List to install" 

Of course +a will install all of the next programs.
